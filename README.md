MagnetiCraft Patcher
====================

To teach myself how to make a coremod I've taken on some bugs in [MagnetiCraft](http://mods.curse.com/mc-mods/minecraft/224808-magneticraft). 
Unfortunately the mod is closed source and development seems to be currently on hiatus or focused on updating to 1.9.4+
 
A coremod is a pretty intrusive thing (and this is my first try at one) so I take absolutely no responsibility for any damage it does to your world.
Saying that, I tested it and it seems to work fine.

**Important:** This is for version 0.6.1-final of MagnetiCraft, it probably won't work with others and may crash you or damage your world if you
try to use it with other versions.

Issues addressed:
* Fixes cout970/Magneticraft-API-and-Issues#84 (shelving unit deleting items)
* Should fix cout970/Magneticraft-API-and-Issues#77 / cout970/Magneticraft-API-and-Issues#82 (pipe interacion)
* Maybe fixes cout970/Magneticraft-API-and-Issues#92 (strange SMP crash)
